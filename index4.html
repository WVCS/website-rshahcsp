    <p> I'm a junior at Westview High School! Some things I love are pasta, plants, and hiking. I'd rate my coding at least a 8/10 because I usually understand what's going on, and only have difficulties fixing silly errors with code processing languages. There is always room to grow though! </p>
    <h2> About the Class! </h2>
  <p> Some things I enjoy in CSP are doing the daily NYT mini and wordle and learning new words from both. I also love eating skittles (thanks Brooke) and watching everyone scramble to try and get cupcakes (mostly Jacob and Andrew). I also quite enjoyed Mason trying to pick a college for weeks :O </p>
